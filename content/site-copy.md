## Services Pages

### Service 1: Web Application Development
**Short Description**: Modern SPAs & server-rendered apps

**Bullets**:
- Scalable backends with clean APIs
- Responsive design across all devices
- Performance-first architecture

**Full Description**: We build fast, reliable web applications that solve real problems. From single-page apps to complex dashboards, we focus on clean code and user experience.

**Challenge**: Most web apps fail because they prioritize features over performance and maintainability. Users expect instant load times and smooth interactions.

**Approach**: We use modern frameworks like Next.js and React with server-side rendering where it matters. Every component is tested, every API call is optimized, and every deployment is automated.

**Result**: Typical projects launch in 8–12 weeks with 90+ Lighthouse performance scores. Our clients see 60% faster load times and 40% higher conversion rates.

**Technologies**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL

---

### Service 2: Mobile App Development
**Short Description**: Native and cross-platform mobile apps

**Bullets**:
- iOS and Android with native performance
- App Store and Play Store publishing
- Offline-first architecture

**Full Description**: Build mobile apps that users love. We handle everything from design to deployment, whether you need native iOS/Android or cross-platform solutions.

**Challenge**: Mobile users expect apps to work instantly, even offline. Poor performance or buggy releases damage trust permanently.

**Approach**: We use React Native for cross-platform speed or native Swift/Kotlin when performance is critical. Every app includes offline support, crash reporting, and analytics from day one.

**Result**: Apps typically launch in 10–14 weeks with 4.5+ star ratings. Our optimization process reduces app size by 40% and improves startup time by 50%.

**Technologies**: React Native, Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, Firebase

---

### Service 3: Desktop App Development
**Short Description**: Electron & native desktop applications

**Bullets**:
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Offline-first with local data storage
- Native system integrations

**Full Description**: Desktop apps for serious work. We build tools that professionals rely on every day, with native performance and deep system integration.

**Challenge**: Desktop users demand reliability and native feel. Web-wrapped apps feel sluggish and lack proper keyboard shortcuts or system integration.

**Approach**: We build with Electron for cross-platform reach or native technologies when performance is critical. Every app includes proper installer, auto-updates, and crash reporting.

**Result**: Desktop apps ship in 10–16 weeks depending on complexity. Our apps use 50% less memory than typical Electron apps and feel truly native.

**Technologies**: Electron, TypeScript, Node.js, .NET, SQLite

---

### Service 4: Domain & Hosting
**Short Description**: Secure DNS, managed hosting, HTTPS + CI/CD

**Bullets**:
- Fast global CDN delivery
- Automated SSL certificates
- One-click deployments with CI/CD

**Full Description**: Reliable hosting that just works. We handle domains, SSL, CDN, and deployments so you can focus on your business.

**Challenge**: Most hosting setups are overcomplicated or unreliable. Manual deployments lead to errors and downtime costs money.

**Approach**: We use modern platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS with automated deployments from Git. Every commit is tested and deployed automatically with zero downtime.

**Result**: 99.9% uptime guaranteed. Deployments happen in under 2 minutes. Global CDN ensures fast load times worldwide.

**Technologies**: Vercel, AWS, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, Docker

---

### Service 5: QA & Testing
**Short Description**: Automated tests, manual QA, performance & security

**Bullets**:
- Automated test suites for every release
- Manual QA on real devices
- Performance and security audits

**Full Description**: Catch bugs before your users do. We build comprehensive test coverage and run real-world QA on every release.

**Challenge**: Most bugs reach production because testing is manual and inconsistent. Security vulnerabilities go unnoticed until it's too late.

**Approach**: We write automated tests alongside code — unit, integration, and end-to-end. Manual QA happens on real devices with real scenarios. Security audits run on every build.

**Result**: Our clients see 80% fewer production bugs and 99% CI pass rates. Security audits catch vulnerabilities before they ship.

**Technologies**: Jest, Playwright, Cypress, GitHub Actions, Lighthouse

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: E-commerce Platform Redesign
**Client**: RetailCo
**Industry**: Retail
**Excerpt**: Rebuilt checkout flow and reduced cart abandonment by 35% for a mid-sized online retailer.

**Challenge**: RetailCo was losing sales due to a confusing checkout process. Cart abandonment rate was 72%, and mobile conversion was especially poor.

**Solution**: We redesigned the entire checkout experience with a single-page flow, guest checkout, and integrated payment options. Built with Next.js and Stripe for instant payments.

**Outcome**: Cart abandonment dropped from 72% to 47%. Mobile conversions increased by 60%. The site now handles 3x traffic with zero downtime.

**Metrics**:
- Cart abandonment reduction: 35%
- Mobile conversion increase: 60%
- Page load time: 1.2s

**Technologies**: Next.js, React, Stripe, PostgreSQL, Vercel

## About Page

### Heading
About Us

### Subheading
We're a team of engineers who believe software should work — without drama, delays, or technical debt

### Who We Are
Naazware Labs started because we were tired of seeing good projects fail due to poor planning, unclear timelines, and over-engineered solutions.

We build software the way it should be built: pragmatic engineering, clear communication, and deliverables that work on day one. No buzzwords, no hype — just solid code and realistic timelines.

Our clients range from startups launching their first product to established companies modernizing legacy systems. What they all have in common: they want a team that delivers what they promise, when they promise it.

### Our Values

**Honest Timelines**: We give realistic estimates and stick to them. If something changes, you'll know immediately — not two weeks after the deadline.

**Pragmatic Engineering**: We use proven technologies and avoid over-engineering. Your project doesn't need microservices or a custom framework — it needs to work.

**Clear Communication**: No jargon, no excuses. We explain technical decisions in plain language and keep you updated every step of the way.

**Quality by Default**: Every line of code is tested. Every deploy is automated. Every bug is tracked. Quality isn't optional — it's how we work.

**Long-term Thinking**: We build for the next five years, not just the next sprint. Your codebase should be maintainable, not a liability.

**Client Success**: We succeed when you succeed. That means understanding your business goals, not just writing code.

### How We Work

**01 - Discovery**: We start by understanding your goals, users, and constraints. No project starts without a clear brief.

**02 - Planning**: We break the project into phases with clear milestones. You'll know exactly what gets delivered and when.

**03 - Development**: We build in two-week sprints with regular demos. You see progress continuously, not just at the end.

**04 - Launch**: We handle deployment, monitoring, and support. You launch with confidence, not crossed fingers.
